Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]



so we need to create two arrays say leftsum and rigthsum


start with left sum

1 1 2 6
24  12 4 1


so can i just multiply all and the divide by self this solution will be more efficient
if we have zero in array then problem will occur



so leftProduct and right product is only best and optimal approach for this


set first element of prefix and last element suffix to to 1 no matter what

start itterating from 1st element

multiple by previous pre with previous num
